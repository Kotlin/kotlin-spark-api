# Kotlin Spark API


Your next API to work with  [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/).

We are looking to have this as a part of https://github.com/apache/spark repository. Consider this beta-quality software.

## Goal

This project adds a missing layer of compatibility between [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/).

Despite Kotlin having first-class compatibility API, Kotlin developers may want to use familiar features like data classes and lambda expressions as simple expressions in curly braces or method references.

## Non-goals

There is no goal to replace any currently supported language or provide other APIs with some functionality to support Kotlin language.

## Installation

Currently, there are no kotlin-spark-api artifacts in maven central, but you can obtain a copy using JitPack here: [![](https://jitpack.io/v/JetBrains/kotlin-spark-api.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#JetBrains/kotlin-spark-api)

There is support for `Maven`, `Gradle`, `SBT`, and `leinengen` on JitPack.

This project does not force you to use any specific version of Spark, but it has only been tested it with spark `3.0.0`.
We believe it can work with Spark `2.4.5` but we cannot guarantee that.

So if you're using Maven you'll have to add the following into your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>jitpack.io</id>
        <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.JetBrains.kotlin-spark-api</groupId>
    <artifactId>kotlin-spark-api</artifactId>
    <version>${kotlin-spark-api.version}</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.spark</groupId>
    <artifactId>spark-sql_2.12</artifactId>
    <version>2.4.5</version>
</dependency>
```

`core` is being compiled against Scala version `2.12` and it means you have to use `2.12` build of spark if you want to try out this project.

## Usage

First (and hopefully last) thing you need to do is to add following import to your Kotlin file:

```kotlin
import org.jetbrains.spark.api.*
```

Then you can create a SparkSession:

```kotlin
val spark = SparkSession
        .builder()
        .master("local[2]")
        .appName("Simple Application").orCreate

```

To create a Dataset you can call `toDS` method:

```kotlin
spark.toDS("a" to 1, "b" to 2)
```

Indeed, this produces `Dataset<Pair<String, Int>>`. There are a couple more `toDS` methods which accept different arguments.

Also, there are several aliases in API, like `leftJoin`, `rightJoin` etc. These are null-safe by design. For example, `leftJoin` is aware of nullability and returns `Dataset<Pair<LEFT, RIGHT?>>`.
Note that we are forcing `RIGHT` to be nullable for you as a developer to be able to handle this situation.

We know that `NullPointerException`s are hard to debug in Spark, and we are trying hard to make them as rare as possible.

## Useful helper methods

### `withSpark`

We provide you with useful function `withSpark`, which accepts everything that may be needed to run Spark — properties, name, master location and so on. It also accepts a block of code to execute inside Spark context.

After work block ends, `spark.stop()` is called automatically.

```kotlin
withSpark {
    dsOf(1, 2)
            .map { it to it }
            .show()
}
```

`dsOf` is just one more way to create `Dataset` (`Dataset<Int>`) from varargs.

### `withCached`

It can easily happen that we need to fork our computation to several paths. To compute things only once we should call `cache`
method. However, it becomes hard to control when we're using cached `Dataset` and when not.
It is also easy to forget to unpersist cached data, which can break things unexpectedly or take more memory
than intended.

To solve these problems we introduce `withCached` function

```kotlin
withSpark {
    dsOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
            .map { it to (it + 2) }
            .withCached {
                showDS()

                filter { it.first % 2 == 0 }.showDS()
            }
            .map { c(it.first, it.second, (it.first + it.second) * 2) }
            .show()
}
```

Here we're showing cached `Dataset` for debugging purposes then filtering it. The `filter` method returns filtered `Dataset` and then the cached `Dataset` is being unpersisted, so we have more memory to call the `map` method and collect the resulting `Dataset`.
