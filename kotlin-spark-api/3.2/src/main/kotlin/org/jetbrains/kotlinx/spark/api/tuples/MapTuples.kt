/**
 * This file provides map-functions to all Tuple variants.
 * Given a tuple `t(a1, ..., an)`, returns a new tuple `t(func(a1), ..., func(an))`.
 * Compared to Scala 3, no type mapping can occur in Kotlin, so to create a `TupleX<T1, T2, ...>`
 * the user will need to explicitly [cast] the result.
 *
 * For example:
 * ```kotlin
 * val myTuple: Tuple4<Int, String, Int, String> = t(1, "3", 2, "4")
 * val myStringTuple: Tuple4<String, Int, String, Int> = myTuple.map {
 *     when (it) {
 *         is Int -> it.toString()
 *         is String -> it.toInt()
 *         else -> error("")
 *     }
 * }.cast<String, Int, String, Int>()
 * ```
